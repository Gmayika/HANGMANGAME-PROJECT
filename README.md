## Overview

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game "Hangman" in Python. Players can choose from different categories and attempt to guess the hidden word by inputting letters.

## Features

- Single-player word-guessing game.
- Multiple categories to choose from.
- Visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
- Option to play again within the same category or choose a new category.

## How to Play

1. Run the `game.py` script.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Choose a category (animals, fruits, sports, colors, movies).
4. Guess letters to uncover the hidden word.
5. Continue playing until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
6. Decide whether to play again in the same category or change the category.

## Project Structure

- `game.py`: The main script to run the Hangman game.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
